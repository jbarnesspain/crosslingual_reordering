Title: Exploring the importance of word order in cross-lingual sentiment analysis


Abstract:
small change

Introduction:

	- intro to task: Why is sentiment analysis cool/useful/difficult?
- motivation for cross-lingual approaches: We often have no annotated data for Language X, especially for specific domains.
- why it's interesting to use no MT: under-resourced languages, MT requires too much parallel data
- what problem that might introduce

Related Work:

- Bilingual Word Embeddings: Artetxe and why we use these: SOTA and low-resource
- Cross-lingual Sentiment Approaches that are relevant here: 
- Word order in sentiment:
- Reordering for machine translation

Methodology:

- Models, motivation for these, and differences regarding word order:
	LSTM
	CNN
	SVM

- Datasets:
	OpeNER: EN, ES
	MultiBooked: CA

- Setup:
	No reordering
	Random Reordering
	No lexicon
	Only lexicon	

Results:

-Big table
	Check statistical differences between runs

Discussion:

- Where does the noise come from?
- Could there be
