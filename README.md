The Effect of Word Order on Cross-lingual Sentiment Analysis
==============

We explore what effects word order has on cross-lingual sentiment classification.
Specifically, we compare models that should be strongly influenced by word order (LSTMs), mildly affected (CNNs), 
and not affected (SVMs with Bag-of-embedding representations).


Requirements to run the experiments

- Python 3
- NumPy
